-- Date: 12/05/2024
-- Adapted from: CS 340 - Introduction to Databases
-- Source URL: Course materials and examples from Oregon State University CS340
-- These stored procedures implement CRUD operations for the Zoo Management Database
-- 
-- AI Tool Usage:
-- Claude AI (Anthropic) was used to generate these stored procedures based on the following prompts:
-- 
-- 1. INSERT Procedures:
--    Prompt: "Create a MySQL stored procedure to insert a new animal into the Animals table. 
--    The procedure should accept parameters for name, dateOfBirth, sex, speciesId, and enclosureId. 
--    It should return the new animalId as an output parameter, or -99 if an error occurs. 
--    Include proper transaction handling and error handling."
--
--    Prompt: "Create a MySQL stored procedure to insert a new zookeeper into the Zookeepers table.
--    Accept firstName, lastName, hireDate, and speciality as input parameters. Return the new 
--    keeperId or -99 on error."
--
--    Prompt: "Create a MySQL stored procedure to insert a new enclosure into the Enclosures table.
--    Accept enclosureType, location, and maximumCapacity as inputs. Return the new enclosureId 
--    or -99 on error."
--
--    Prompt: "Create a MySQL stored procedure to insert a new species into the Species table.
--    Accept name, scientificName, diet, and vertType as inputs. Return the new speciesId or 
--    -99 on error."
--
--    Prompt: "Create a MySQL stored procedure to insert a new enclosure assignment into the 
--    EnclosureAssignments table (M:M relationship). Accept keeperId and enclosureId as inputs. 
--    Return 1 for success or -99 on error."
--
-- 2. UPDATE Procedures:
--    Prompt: "Create a MySQL stored procedure to update an existing animal record. Accept 
--    animalId and all updatable fields (name, dateOfBirth, sex, speciesId, enclosureId) as 
--    parameters. Return the number of rows affected as an output parameter, or -99 on error."
--
--    Prompt: "Create a MySQL stored procedure to update an existing zookeeper record. Accept
--    keeperId and all updatable fields (firstName, lastName, hireDate, speciality). Return
--    ROW_COUNT() or -99 on error."
--
--    Prompt: "Create a MySQL stored procedure to update an existing enclosure record. Accept
--    enclosureId and all updatable fields (enclosureType, location, maximumCapacity). Return
--    ROW_COUNT() or -99 on error."
--
--    Prompt: "Create a MySQL stored procedure to update an existing species record. Accept
--    speciesId and all updatable fields (name, scientificName, diet, vertType). Return
--    ROW_COUNT() or -99 on error."
--
--    Prompt: "Create a MySQL stored procedure to update an enclosure assignment (M:M relationship).
--    Accept the old keeperId and enclosureId to identify the record, plus new keeperId and 
--    enclosureId to update it. Return ROW_COUNT() or -99 on error."
--
-- 3. DELETE Procedures:
--    Prompt: "Create a MySQL stored procedure to delete an animal by animalId. Return the 
--    number of rows deleted or -99 on error. Include proper transaction handling."
--
--    Prompt: "Create a MySQL stored procedure to delete a zookeeper by keeperId. The procedure
--    should first delete all related enclosure assignments to prevent data anomalies, then
--    delete the zookeeper. Return ROW_COUNT() or -99 on error."
--
--    Prompt: "Create a MySQL stored procedure to delete an enclosure by enclosureId. First
--    delete all related enclosure assignments, then delete the enclosure. Return ROW_COUNT()
--    or -99 on error."
--
--    Prompt: "Create a MySQL stored procedure to delete a species by speciesId. Return
--    ROW_COUNT() or -99 on error with proper transaction handling."
--
--    Prompt: "Create a MySQL stored procedure to delete an enclosure assignment by the
--    composite key (keeperId, enclosureId). Return ROW_COUNT() or -99 on error."
